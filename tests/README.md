# Tests

The project uses Qt Test for assertions and CTest to discover and run tests.
The Qt kit must include the Qt Test module. Tests are separate executables and
are not installed with the application.

## Build and run

In Qt Creator, enable `BUILD_TESTING` in the CMake configuration (default: ON),
reconfigure, and build the project. Use the kit's developer terminal to run:

```powershell
$buildDir = 'build/Desktop_Qt_6_12_0_MSVC2022_64bit_Debug'
ctest --test-dir $buildDir -N
ctest --test-dir $buildDir --output-on-failure
```

Replace the build directory when using another kit. CTest does not build the
test executables; build after changing code before running tests.

For an already configured build directory, the command-line equivalent is:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B $buildDir -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build $buildDir --config Debug
ctest --test-dir $buildDir -C Debug --output-on-failure
```

Use a terminal with the selected MSVC compiler and build tool available. For a
multi-configuration generator, `-C Debug` must match the configuration built.
To omit test targets, reconfigure with `-DBUILD_TESTING=OFF`.

## Current coverage

`ui.mainwindow` is a smoke test that creates, shows and closes the existing main
window. It verifies the test pipeline, not the planned recording features or
the appearance of the UI. It runs with Qt's `offscreen` platform plugin and
has a 15-second timeout. Its command supplies this kit's Qt DLL and plugin paths.

```powershell
ctest --test-dir $buildDir -L smoke --output-on-failure
```

## Adding tests with features

- Add tests for meaningful behavior as each feature is implemented, rather than
  asserting placeholder controls or exact pixel positions.
- Prefer fixed images, generated audio and controllable inputs for repeatability.
- Register each executable with `add_test`, give it a clear name and label,
  and set a timeout. Additional executables can follow `tst_mainwindow`.
- Future logic tests should not require a GUI. UI interaction tests can use
  Qt Test; asynchronous assertions should wait for a condition with a timeout.
- GPU and real-device tests need their own environment and explicit opt-in;
  do not force them to use the smoke test's offscreen plugin or make them part
  of the default device-free run.
- Record unverified device behavior separately. A passing smoke test does not
  establish camera compatibility, audio synchronization or recording quality.
